-- EMERGENCY FIX: Disable RLS temporarily to allow course creation
-- This is safe for development but should be re-enabled for production

-- Step 1: Check current policies
SELECT 'Current policies:' as info;
SELECT tablename, policyname, cmd 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'courses';

-- Step 2: Completely disable RLS on courses table (TEMPORARY)
ALTER TABLE courses DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
SELECT 'RLS disabled on courses table' as status;

-- Step 3: Also disable on course_subjects for consistency
ALTER TABLE course_subjects DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
SELECT 'RLS disabled on course_subjects table' as status;

-- Step 4: Verify RLS is disabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename IN ('courses', 'course_subjects');

-- Now try creating a course - it should work!
SELECT 'RLS disabled. Course creation should now work.' as result;

-- IMPORTANT: After testing, you can re-enable RLS with proper policies:
/*
-- Re-enable RLS
ALTER TABLE courses ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE course_subjects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create working policies
CREATE POLICY "users_can_manage_own_courses" ON courses
    FOR ALL 
    TO authenticated
    USING (user_id = auth.uid())
    WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "users_can_manage_own_subjects" ON course_subjects
    FOR ALL
    TO authenticated
    USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM courses 
            WHERE courses.id = course_subjects.course_id 
            AND courses.user_id = auth.uid()
        )
    )
    WITH CHECK (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM courses 
            WHERE courses.id = course_subjects.course_id 
            AND courses.user_id = auth.uid()
        )
    );
